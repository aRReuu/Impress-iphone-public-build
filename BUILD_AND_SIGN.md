# BUILD_AND_SIGN — Impress V3.2 public feature branch

## Current executable workflow
For active V3.2 use `feature/impress-v3-r04-2-build` and `.github/workflows/r04-2-privacy-retirement-validation.yml`. Other older R03/main or calibration-v01 workflows have different trigger rules and must not be treated as sign-off of the active branch.

GitHub Actions installs pinned CocoaPods, runs all portable Swift Core tests (including calibration), audits retired native Chat and public Git history for credentials, compiles the Simulator app, runs full UIKit XCTest, compiles the `aReuImpress-iPhone-AltStore` iPhoneOS ARM64 app with `CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO`, verifies executable, unsigned state, ZIP and SHA-256, and uploads the testing Artifact.

## Explicitly incomplete original App Icon
Public source intentionally includes seven unchanged original iPhone AppIcon PNGs but lacks byte-identical `AppIcon.appiconset/icon_1024.png` (expected Git blob `f5a0edd2f317c7104441ee8798fb0fbf00cff9e5`). No image is generated or scaled to replace it.
The native-qa CI modifies `Contents.json` **only inside its ephemeral runner** to omit the unavailable App Store marketing slot. An artifact whose IPA name includes `7icon-INCOMPLETE-unsigned` is thus a development candidate, never a Release PASS. `.github/scripts/verify_public_mirror.py` intentionally continues to fail the full eight-icon release gate until the owner explicitly supplies the authentic binary. Do not turn the gate off.

## Validation commands
On a trusted Mac with matching Xcode/CocoaPods:

```bash
swift test --package-path Packages/ImpressReviewCore --parallel
python3 .github/scripts/verify_retired_native_chat.py
python3 .github/scripts/check_git_history_secrets.py
pod install --repo-update
xcodebuild -workspace aReuImpress-iPhone.xcworkspace -scheme aReuImpress-iPhone -configuration Debug -destination 'generic/platform=iOS Simulator' IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=15.0 CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO build
xcodebuild -workspace aReuImpress-iPhone.xcworkspace -scheme aReuImpress-iPhone-AltStore -configuration Debug -sdk iphoneos -destination 'generic/platform=iOS' IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=15.0 CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO CODE_SIGN_ENTITLEMENTS= ENABLE_DEBUG_DYLIB=NO build
```

The full XCTest requires a real available iPhone Simulator destination and the project's shared XCTest scheme; consult CI rather than substituting a build-only command for the test result. New acceptance requires regression of live System/Light/Dark switching, three persisted UI languages, stale-safe understanding edits with historical revisions, native Notes grouped-list style and read-only Markdown document presentation. Do not run the six non-icon placeholder generator on original icons.

## User signing and iCloud limitations
The IPA is unsigned and must be signed with the user's own Apple identity/provisioning on a compatible tool. A free Personal Team can restrict iCloud and App Groups entitlements; removing entitlement requests may allow installation **but does not certify iCloud Files Provider access**. iCloud backup folder selection, security-scoped bookmarks, notification delivery after reboot, time-zone changes and dark/light UI require iPhone 13 physical QA.

## Provenance
Use GitHub Actions Artifact URL from the exact target SHA, SHA256SUMS / IPA_SHA256, Xcode job logs, and the application's bundle ID. `SOURCE_MANIFEST.json` preserves historical mirror provenance but its historical blob digests are not a claim that current V3.2 files are byte-identical to that snapshot. Never declare a Release, or modify private/main branches, without separate authorization.
